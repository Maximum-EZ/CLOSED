<text>Welcome to Max-EZ!</text>

<text>This page is for ads so I can afford a real domain. Max-EZ is an unblocked cloaker that brings you to an about:blank page in order to hide any website from schools. Upon clicking continue you will be loaded into a proxy called Interstellar. Make sure to support Interstellar Network on GitHub</text>
