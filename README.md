# Forking
Max-EZ is open source so you can fork and deploy it using a site of your choice. This is **ONLY** for helping make new sites.

Max-EZ is **NOT** open source so you can **CHANGE** my code. Violation of our license **WILL** lead to your GitHub account being **TERMINATED**, and your repo being **DELETED**.

**Note:** Upon Loading into this site, you will be put into an about:blank page so schools cant see what you are doing.
  
### Important

**Note:** You can deploy Max-EZ to **Cloudflare Pages, Netlify and Vercel** but these are only some of the sites you can use, so some might be blocked.
